# Jenna Christensen's Backend Developer Challenge Submission

Hi! This is my submission for the Ada Support Backend Developer Challenge.

To run my service, you will first need to have Node.js installed, and an instance of MongoDB running on  port 27017. In command line, enter the project folder, and run "npm run start". You should see the line "Ada Support Challenge is running on: http://localhost:8080/" come up.

I have included a Postman collection (named Jenna's API Tests.postman_collection) with some sample requests to do some basic testing of my service.

Thank you for taking a look at my code. Please feel free to reach out with question and/or comments.
